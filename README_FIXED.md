# Unika Housing Society Website - FIXED VERSION

## 🔧 ISSUES FIXED

This version resolves the following problems:

### ✅ Character Encoding Fixed
- **Removed all special characters and emojis** that were showing as ðï¸
- **Replaced with simple text**: "Community Hub" instead of "🏠 Community Hub"
- **Web-safe fonts only**: Arial, sans-serif (no Google Fonts dependency)
- **Proper UTF-8 encoding** throughout all files

### ✅ Metadata Loading Fixed  
- **Dual location support**: Checks both root folder AND data folder
- **Automatic fallback**: Embedded data if no metadata file found
- **Better error handling**: Console logging for debugging
- **Flexible file placement**: Works whether you put video_metadata.js in same folder or data folder

## 🚀 QUICK START

### For Windows Users:
1. **Double-click `run_extraction_fixed.bat`**
2. Wait for completion
3. Upload entire folder to GitHub Pages

### Manual Steps:
1. `pip install requests`
2. `python extract_metadata_fixed.py` 
3. Upload to GitHub Pages

## 📁 FILE LOCATIONS

The metadata extractor now creates files in BOTH locations:

- **`video_metadata.js`** (root folder) - Website loads this first
- **`data/video_metadata.js`** (backup copy) - Fallback location
- **`data/unika_youtube_metadata_[date].json`** (JSON backup)

## 🌐 WEBSITE COMPATIBILITY

The website is now smart about loading metadata:

1. **First tries**: `./video_metadata.js` (same folder as website)
2. **Then tries**: `./data/video_metadata.js` (data subfolder)
3. **Falls back**: Embedded data (always works)

## ✨ WEBSITE FEATURES

- 🏠 **Sticky floating navigation** (no character issues)
- 📱 **Mobile-friendly design** with web-safe fonts
- ⚡ **Fast loading** with lazy loading
- 🎬 **Video galleries** with YouTube thumbnails
- 📸 **Photo galleries** linked to Google Drive

## 📤 GITHUB PAGES DEPLOYMENT

1. Create new GitHub repository
2. Upload ALL files from this folder
3. Go to Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch (main)
4. Site will be live at: `https://yourusername.github.io/repositoryname`

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING
